Determine if a number is odd or even
You'll be given a variable called number.
Your task: If number is odd, return True. If number is even, return False
hint:
A % (modulo) is a way to determine the remainder after dividing a number. For example, if we did remainder = 5% 2, 
remainder would hold the value of 1 because 2 can go into 5, 2 times, and then it has 1 as the remainder. You can use this to help you decide if a number is odd or even.

def your_code():
    
    number = 7

    # Your code goes here.
    remainder = number % 2
    if remainder == 1:
        print("odd")
    else:
        print("even")
    

    return True
